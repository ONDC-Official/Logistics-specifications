        non-living entity like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of agents are
        Doctor in the healthcare sector, a driver in the mobility sector, or a
        delivery person in the logistics sector. This object can be set at any
        stage of the order lifecycle. This can be set at the discovery stage
        when the BPP wants to provide details on the agent fulfilling the order,
        like in healthcare, where the doctor's name appears during search. This
        object can also used to search for a particular person that the customer
        wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this object gets instantiated
        after the order is confirmed, like in the case of on-demand taxis, where
        the driver is assigned after the user confirms the ride.

        conference link during a teleconsultation.

    Context:
      description: >-
        Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a high-level
        overview to the receiver about the nature of the intended transaction.
        Typically, it is the BAP that sets the transaction context based on the
        consumer's location and action on their UI. But sometimes, during
        unsolicited callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
        is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
        request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP. The context
        object contains four types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information
        about the transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
        `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and receiving

        transaction_id that represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a

        sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key
        to encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
        passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
        implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during the
        synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the context
        must be sent during all interactions,

        keeping in mind relevance, performance, and opportunity cost. It is

        the BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of payment. However, the
        BAP can send its terms to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
        those terms, it must overwrite the terms and return them to the BAP. If
        overridden, the BAP must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP in
        order to preserve the provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
        case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform offline
        negotiations on the payment terms. Once an agreement is reached, the BAP
        and BPP can resume transactions.

        better search functionality. Tags are sent by the BPP as part of the
        catalog response in the `on_search` callback. Tags are also meant for
        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag, BAPs are meant to render them as
        name-value pairs. This is particularly useful when rendering tabular

        Contains any additional or extended inputs required to confirm an order.
        This is typically a Form Input. Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
        is not enough for the BPP to confirm an order. For example, to confirm a
        flight ticket, the airline requires details of the passengers along with
        information on baggage, identity, in addition to the class of ticket.
        Similarly, a logistics company may require details on the nature of
        shipment in order to confirm the shipping. A recruiting firm may require
        additional details on the applicant in order to confirm a job
        application. For all such purposes, the BPP can choose to send this
        object attached to any object in the catalog that is required to be sent
        while placing the order. This object can typically be sent at an item
        level or at the order level. The item level XInput will override the
        Order level XInput as it indicates a special requirement of information
        for that particular item. Hence the BAP must render a separate form for
        the Item and another form at the Order level before confirmation.

    details:
      - description: >
          This flow defines the logistics order process for <b>Baseline
          Features</b> to be implemented by all Network participants transacting
          on version 1.2.5.<br>


          These features are:<br>  
            - <b>Catalog Live Search</b><br>
            - <b>Feature discovery</b><br>
            - <b>Payment collector updating settlement window & settlement terms</b><br>
            - <b>Updated RTO order state</b><br>
            - <b>Shipment type for P2H2P orders</b><br>
            - <b>Single pickup, single drop (SPSD)</b><br>
            - <b>Order / fulfillment status updates</b><br>
            - <b>Cancellation</b><br>
            - <b>RTO</b><br>
            - <b>P2P - live tracking</b><br><br>

          Other <b>Baseline Features</b> include:<br>
            - <b>Settlement window & settlement terms</b> to be provided, for the order, by the payment collector<br>
            - For <b>P2H2P shipments</b>, the shipment type ("flyer", "box") will be used to compute the weight for pricing:<br>
              - <b>"Flyer"</b>: If dead weight < 1 kg, use dead weight else max(dead weight, volumetric weight)<br>
              - <b>"Box"</b>: max(dead weight, volumetric weight)<br>
              - For <b>"Box"</b> shipment type, weight for pricing = max(dead weight, volumetric weight). If the box dimensions are large, it will take a lot of space and handling at the logistic end, e.g.:<br>
                - Seller sends 500g shipment (dead weight) with 22x20x18cm dimension box.<br>
                - Volumetric weight is 1.5kg (22*20*18/5000).<br>
                - Hence, weight for pricing is 1.5kg.<br><br>

          The <b>Immediate Delivery Flow</b> outlines the process for confirming
          and updating logistics orders with the <b>Logistics Service Provider
          (LSP)</b> and the <b>Logistics Buyer Network Partner (LBNP)</b>.</br>


          When confirming the order, the <b>LBNP</b> must send the following
          information in /confirm:</br>

          - Estimated order preparation time</br>

          - <b>"ready_to_ship" = "yes"</b></br>

          - Reference retail order ID</br>

          - Static OTP for pickup/delivery verification (optional, as
          required)</br>

          </br>

          The <b>LBNP</b> should use their estimate of the order preparation
          time along with the LSP's estimated pickup time to determine when to
          place the logistics order. If the conditions aren't met, the
          <b>LSP</b> can reject the order confirmation (<b>NACK</b>) with error
          code <b>65005</b>.</br>

          </br>

          Once the order is ready for shipment, the <b>LBNP</b> sends
          <b>"order_ready" = "yes"</b> via <b>/update</b> to notify the
          LSP.</br>

          </br>

          The rider must set the fulfillment state to <b>"At-pickup"</b> after
          reaching the perimeter of the pickup location, via <b>/on_status</b>.

  - summary: Return to Origin (RTO) Flow
    details:
      - description: >
          This flow outlines the <b>Return to Origin (RTO)</b> process for
          <b>Logistics Service Providers (LSPs)</b> to handle situations where
          the buyer is unavailable, an accident occurs, or other unforeseen
          circumstances arise while the rider is out for delivery.</br>

          </br>

          A separate fulfillment will be created for <b>RTO</b> (type =
          "RTO").</br>

          The forward shipment fulfillment will be linked to the <b>RTO</b>
          fulfillment via "rto_event".</br>

          Since <b>LSPs</b> track a single shipment status for both the forward
          shipment and <b>RTO</b>:</br>

          - The forward shipment fulfillment will be set to its terminal state
          (<b>"RTO"</b>).</br>

          - The fulfillment state for <b>RTO</b> fulfillment will be updated to
          <b>"RTO-Initiated"</b>.</br>

          - The order quote will be updated to include <b>RTO</b> costs before
          the order or <b>RTO</b> fulfillment reaches its terminal state.</br>

          - The terminal states for <b>RTO</b> fulfillment are
          <b>"RTO-Delivered"</b> or <b>"RTO-Disposed"</b>.</br>

          - The terminal state for the order is <b>"Completed"</b> once the
          <b>RTO</b> fulfillment reaches its terminal state.</br>

  - summary: Prepaid Payment collected by LSP (Payment Wallet)
    details:
      - description: >
          This flow outlines the <b>Payment Wallet process</b> for <b>Logistics
          Service Providers (LSPs)</b>, enabling them to establish a prepaid
          wallet system for logistics buyers. Payments for services are deducted
          directly from this wallet, ensuring a seamless and efficient
          transaction process.

          </br>

          A <b>prepaid payment system</b> for logistics can be facilitated
          through a payment wallet managed by the <b>Logistics Service Provider
          (LSP)</b> on behalf of the <b>Logistics Buyer Network Partner
          (LBNP)</b>.</br>  

          The creation and maintenance of this wallet will be handled
          off-network. The <b>LSP</b> may establish the wallet during dynamic
          onboarding, notify the <b>LBNP</b> using the contact details provided
          via the protocol, and the <b>LBNP</b> can top up the balance as
          required.</br>  

          For payment type <b>"ON-ORDER"</b>, the current wallet balance can be
          provided by the <b>LSP</b> when the <b>LBNP</b> requests a
          quote.</br>  

          The wallet will be automatically debited for logistics
          transactions:</br>  

          - Wallet balance will be <b>blocked</b> during the <b>/on_init</b>
          stage.</br>  

          - Wallet balance will be <b>auto-debited</b> upon
          <b>/on_confirm</b>.</br>  

          - If there is insufficient wallet balance, the <b>LSP</b> may reject
          the order confirmation with an appropriate error code.</br>  

          - In case of order cancellation, the debited wallet balance must be
          <b>reversed</b>.</br>

    summary: Logistics Use Case Specification
    description: >-
      The logistics use case on the network would enable NPs to perform
      logistics ride hailing related transactions on the network. These APIs are
      utilized by consumer and provider platforms enabling every consumer/
      end-user on all consumer platforms to consume the services/ inventory
      provided by all provider platforms on the network seamlessly.  Consumer
      platforms shall use these specifications to perform transaction operations
      like discovery, selection, booking, status check and others so as to
      purchase services/ inventory on the network eg: autos, cabs etc. Provider
      Platform shall use these specifications to expose their services/
      inventory in form of autos or cabs rides. Gateway specifications are used
      to broadcast demands originating from a consumer platform to all
      applicable provider platforms in a transparent and unbiased manner.

        This is the annual rate of interest that the Payment Collector will be

        the value is set as “7.3”, and the amount of payment due is INR 1000,
        that will mean the Payment Collector will pay the counterparty Network
        Participant an interest of 7.3% per annum (i.e. INR 100), calculated pro
        rata for each day of delay. So if the Payment Collector delay was 50

        1000x(7.3/100)x(50/365)]

        Protocol. If there is a conflict between the terms decided through the
        Protocol, and the Static Terms, the terms decided through the ONDC
        Protocol will prevail. Also, if there is a conflict between the Static
        Terms and the ONDC Network Policy or the Static Terms and the Network
        Participant Agreement, the terms of the ONDC Network Policy or the
        Network Participant Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail.
