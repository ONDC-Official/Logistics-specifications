summary: Return to Origin (RTO) Flow

details:
  - description: |
      This flow outlines the <b>Return to Origin (RTO)</b> process for <b>Logistics Service Providers (LSPs)</b> to handle situations where the buyer is unavailable, an accident occurs, or other unforeseen circumstances arise while the rider is out for delivery.</br>
      </br>
      A separate fulfillment will be created for <b>RTO</b> (type = "RTO").</br>
      The forward shipment fulfillment will be linked to the <b>RTO</b> fulfillment via "rto_event".</br>
      Since <b>LSPs</b> track a single shipment status for both the forward shipment and <b>RTO</b>:</br>
      - The forward shipment fulfillment will be set to its terminal state (<b>"RTO"</b>).</br>
      - The fulfillment state for <b>RTO</b> fulfillment will be updated to <b>"RTO-Initiated"</b>.</br>
      - The order quote will be updated to include <b>RTO</b> costs before the order or <b>RTO</b> fulfillment reaches its terminal state.</br>
      - The terminal states for <b>RTO</b> fulfillment are <b>"RTO-Delivered"</b> or <b>"RTO-Disposed"</b>.</br>
      - The terminal state for the order is <b>"Completed"</b> once the <b>RTO</b> fulfillment reaches its terminal state.</br>
