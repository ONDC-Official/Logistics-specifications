summary: Prepaid Payment collected by LSP (Payment Wallet)

details:
  - description: |
      This flow outlines the <b>Payment Wallet process</b> for <b>Logistics Service Providers (LSPs)</b>, enabling them to establish a prepaid wallet system for logistics buyers. Payments for services are deducted directly from this wallet, ensuring a seamless and efficient transaction process.
      </br>
      A <b>prepaid payment system</b> for logistics can be facilitated through a payment wallet managed by the <b>Logistics Service Provider (LSP)</b> on behalf of the <b>Logistics Buyer Network Partner (LBNP)</b>.</br>  
      The creation and maintenance of this wallet will be handled off-network. The <b>LSP</b> may establish the wallet during dynamic onboarding, notify the <b>LBNP</b> using the contact details provided via the protocol, and the <b>LBNP</b> can top up the balance as required.</br>  
      For payment type <b>"ON-ORDER"</b>, the current wallet balance can be provided by the <b>LSP</b> when the <b>LBNP</b> requests a quote.</br>  
      The wallet will be automatically debited for logistics transactions:</br>  
      - Wallet balance will be <b>blocked</b> during the <b>/on_init</b> stage.</br>  
      - Wallet balance will be <b>auto-debited</b> upon <b>/on_confirm</b>.</br>  
      - If there is insufficient wallet balance, the <b>LSP</b> may reject the order confirmation with an appropriate error code.</br>  
      - In case of order cancellation, the debited wallet balance must be <b>reversed</b>.</br>
