summary: Order Flow (Baseline)
details:
  - description: |
      This flow defines the logistics order process for <b>Baseline Features</b> to be implemented by all Network participants transacting on version 1.2.5.<br>

      These features are:<br>  
        - <b>Catalog Live Search</b><br>
        - <b>Feature discovery</b><br>
        - <b>Payment collector updating settlement window & settlement terms</b><br>
        - <b>Updated RTO order state</b><br>
        - <b>Shipment type for P2H2P orders</b><br>
        - <b>Single pickup, single drop (SPSD)</b><br>
        - <b>Order / fulfillment status updates</b><br>
        - <b>Cancellation</b><br>
        - <b>RTO</b><br>
        - <b>P2P - live tracking</b><br><br>

      Other <b>Baseline Features</b> include:<br>
        - <b>Settlement window & settlement terms</b> to be provided, for the order, by the payment collector<br>
        - For <b>P2H2P shipments</b>, the shipment type ("flyer", "box") will be used to compute the weight for pricing:<br>
          - <b>"Flyer"</b>: If dead weight < 1 kg, use dead weight else max(dead weight, volumetric weight)<br>
          - <b>"Box"</b>: max(dead weight, volumetric weight)<br>
          - For <b>"Box"</b> shipment type, weight for pricing = max(dead weight, volumetric weight). If the box dimensions are large, it will take a lot of space and handling at the logistic end, e.g.:<br>
            - Seller sends 500g shipment (dead weight) with 22x20x18cm dimension box.<br>
            - Volumetric weight is 1.5kg (22*20*18/5000).<br>
            - Hence, weight for pricing is 1.5kg.<br><br>

        %% Step 1: Searching
        LBNP ->> LSP: **/search** - Initiate search request with key parameters
        LSP ->> LBNP: **/on_search** - Respond with catalog and rate card

        %% Step 2: Order Initialization
        LBNP ->> LSP: **/init** - Select LSP & initialize order
        LSP ->> LBNP: **/on_init** - Provide quote breakup

        %% Step 3: Order Confirmation
        LBNP ->> LSP: **/confirm** - Send order confirmation
        LSP ->> LBNP: **/on_confirm** - Order acceptance 

        %% Step 4: Order Updates
        LBNP ->> LSP: **/update** - Send order update request
        LSP ->> LBNP: **/on_update** - Provide shipping label or weight differential charges

        %% Step 5: Order Status & Tracking
        LSP ->> LBNP: **/on_status** - Send latest order status

        LBNP ->> LSP: **/track** - Request live tracking updates
        LSP ->> LBNP: **/on_track** - Send real-time tracking details

          - If LBNP receives NACK, they must cancel the order with reason code <b>996</b> (Order confirmation failure).<br>
          - If LSP receives the same `order_id` in subsequent API calls (`/confirm`, `/status`, `/cancel`, `/update`), it returns NACK (error code <b>66004</b> - Order not found).<br>
          - LSP may NACK due to internal errors (HTTP 504, error code <b>66001</b> - Retriable error).<br>

            - If LSP receives NACK, it cancels the order with reason code <b>997</b> (Order confirmation failure) and pushes the status update to LBNP.<br>
          - If the cancelled order appears in later API calls (`/on_confirm`, `/on_status`, `/on_cancel`, `/on_update`), LBNP responds with ACK.<br>
          - If LBNP encounters internal errors (HTTP 504/503, error code <b>63001</b>), LSP should retry `/on_confirm`.<br>
            - If no ACK/NACK is received within the retry interval, LSP cancels the order with reason code <b>997</b>.<br>
          - If the order is in progress and appears in API calls (`/status`, `/track`, `/cancel`, `/update`), LSP responds with the current order state along with error code <b>66003</b> (Order processing in progress).<br>
