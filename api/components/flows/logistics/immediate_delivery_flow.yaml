  - description: |
      The <b>Immediate Delivery Flow</b> outlines the process for confirming and updating logistics orders with the <b>Logistics Service Provider (LSP)</b> and the <b>Logistics Buyer Network Partner (LBNP)</b>.</br>

      When confirming the order, the <b>LBNP</b> must send the following information in /confirm:</br>
      - Estimated order preparation time</br>
      - <b>"ready_to_ship" = "yes"</b></br>
      - Reference retail order ID</br>
      - Static OTP for pickup/delivery verification (optional, as required)</br>
      </br>
      The <b>LBNP</b> should use their estimate of the order preparation time along with the LSP's estimated pickup time to determine when to place the logistics order. If the conditions aren't met, the <b>LSP</b> can reject the order confirmation (<b>NACK</b>) with error code <b>65005</b>.</br>
      </br>
      Once the order is ready for shipment, the <b>LBNP</b> sends <b>"order_ready" = "yes"</b> via <b>/update</b> to notify the LSP.</br>
      </br>
      The rider must set the fulfillment state to <b>"At-pickup"</b> after reaching the perimeter of the pickup location, via <b>/on_status</b>.
